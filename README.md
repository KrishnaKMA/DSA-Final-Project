How to Play

After running the script, follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Here's a brief overview of the steps you'll need to follow:

Enter the Number of Cards for Player 1:

You will be prompted to enter the number of cards for Player 1. This number must be between 1 and 999.
Enter Player 1's Cards:

Enter each card for Player 1 as prompted. Cards should be entered in the format ValueSuit (e.g., 2H, JC). The value must be one of the following: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A.
Enter the Number of Cards for Player 2:

Similar to Player 1, you will be prompted to enter the number of cards for Player 2.
Enter Player 2's Cards:

Enter each card for Player 2 as prompted, following the same format as for Player 1.
The game will automatically proceed after all cards have been entered. The winner or a tie result (PAT) will be displayed at the end of the game.

Game Rules
The game compares the cards drawn by each player in each round.
The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.
In case of a tie, a "war" occurs, and both players draw three additional cards followed by one card to battle again.
The game ends when one player wins all the cards or both players run out of cards, resulting in a tie.
